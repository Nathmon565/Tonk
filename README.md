# Tonk
Tonk is a small 1 person passion project to create a 3d arcade style tank game. I've been working on it since about May of 2018. It's my main source of learning and experimenting in the Unity engine, and eventually dabbling in multiplayer.

### DISCLAIMER
Tonk is in **very** early development, and is probably *riddled* with bugs. Please be patient if you encounter something that just totally breaks the game.
There really isn't much going on in this project right now, so don't expect a whole bunch of content, but there are plenty of plans, even past the TODO/issues list

### Bugfixing and testing
If you decide you're willing to try out my garbage game and discover one of the literally infinite bugs, feel free - but please make sure to check the issues tab before creating a new bug report. I assume it's common etiquette, but who knows.
